In this talk, we will delve into the asymptotic study of simple linear generative models when both the sample size and data dimension grow to infinity. In this high-dimensional regime, random matrix theory (RMT) appears to be a natural tool to assess the modelâ€™s performance by examining its asymptotic learned conditional probabilities, its associated fluctuations, and the model's generalization error. This analytical approach not only enhances our comprehension of generative language models but might also offer novel insights into their refinement through the lens of high-dimensional statistics and RMT.
